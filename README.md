# dotnet-demos
Sample code for .NET learners

This repository contains simple programs that illustrate key aspects of the .NET Framework. The code is written in C#

These demos have been created as companions to the .NET courses I teach where they are accompanied with my explanations but most could be of use on their own. Their titles are fairly self descriptive.

The following ones are available for the moment:

* ReflectionDemo

Illusrates use of reflection by means of one of its most common applications - unit test for a private method

* DateTimeOperators

Want to know what happens when you add or subtract DateTime and TimeSpan instances? Run this code and you'll see.
Bonus: Implementing custom operators
